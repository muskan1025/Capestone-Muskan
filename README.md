Design Decisions for Mockup

Colors  
The primary background color is a royal white, chosen to create a clean, sophisticated, and timeless look that puts the emphasis on the featured astronomy images. The neutral backdrop highlights the vibrant colors and intricate details of celestial photographs, making each image more captivating. Accents of deep navy and soft gray are added sparingly to frame content and guide user attention without distracting from the main visual elements.

Fonts
A combination of modern and elegant typefaces has been selected to complement the crisp white background. The main headings use a bold, sans-serif font, offering a sharp contrast that stands out against the light backdrop and draws the user's focus. Body text is set in a clean, readable serif font, enhancing the readability of the educational content and maintaining a professional appearance. This font pairing ensures a smooth reading experience while maintaining the elegance of the design.

Simple Design 
The layout embraces simplicity, aligning with the royal white background to maintain a serene and organized aesthetic. Minimalist elements and ample whitespace allow the featured image to be the focal point, guiding the userâ€™s gaze effortlessly. Navigation is kept straightforward and intuitive, ensuring that users can explore the site with ease. This simple design ensures that the project remains visually appealing and user-friendly, focusing on the beauty and wonder of astronomy.
